        <h1>King In Yellow</h1>
    <h1>---- !!Cassilda's Song.!! -----</h1>
    <p>Along the shore the cloud waves break,
        The twin suns sink behind* the lake,
        The shadows lengthen
        In Carcosa.
        Strange is the night where black stars rise,
        And strange moons circle through the skies
        But stranger still is
        Lost Carcosa.
        Songs that the Hyades shall sing,
        Where flap the tatters of the King,
        Must die unheard in
        Dim Carcosa.
        Song of my soul, my voice is dead;
        Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed
        Shall dry and die in
        Lost Carcosa.</p>
